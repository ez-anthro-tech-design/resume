            <h2> I:</h2>
            <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,
                and economic factors in every arena of social life (Estroff, 1988). Instead of adopting a horizontal
                approach that views all individuals as equals in the ever-sinking whirlpool of Capitalism, critical
                medical anthropology delineates the "vertical links" connecting different social groups positioned
                along the non-hierarchical axis of social life. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology
                addresses the social alignment of power that profits a small group of individuals while exploiting
                the large mass of others who are marginalised in the Capitalocene (Singer, 1989). Critical medical
                anthropology looks beyond the socioculturalist view, which delved too deeply into the microlevel
                analysis of social life to the extent of lacking, if not completely neglecting, the macro level view
                of external political and economic forces that also shape the health behaviours and outcomes of
                populations. This essay aims to provide readers with a macro-level approach to human suffering and
                illness in critical medical anthropology, lifting our gaze from immersing too deeply in the
                fascinating minutiae of field experiences (Singer, 1989). This essay will first examine what is
                'critical' about critical medical anthropology by discussing how it marries broader social relations
                of the political economy to micro-level understandings of local sociocultural insights into
                suffering and illness. Extending the realisation of power, control, and exploitation in political
                economy, this essay will further address the ‘criticals’ of CMA through a discussion on the
                shortcomings of the biomedical model in creating a dichotomy between natural and cultural
                constructions of of health, disease, and illness (Singer and Baer, 2004). After dispelling the
                dichotomised view of sociocultural and biological roots of suffering, another ‘critical’ aspect of
                critical medical anthropology is recognising suffering as a syndemic in the context of a biosocial
                construction of health (Singer et al., 2017). The syndemics of health thus emphasise who some of the
                subjects of critical medical anthropology studies are - those who have long been marginalised,
                victimised, and neglected in the discussion of health policies due to the medical hegemony of
                Western biomedical values, coupled with the global adoption of a capitalist political economy. In
                this regard, critical medical anthropology can illustrate how, even with a deeper exploration of the
                nuances of sociocultural influences on health behaviours, medical pluralism remains 'plural' rather
                than 'pluralistic' under the dominance of biomedicine (Singer and Baer, 2004).
            </p>
            <p> The term ‘critical’ within critical medical anthropology has often been employed interchangeably with
                political economy when it comes to understanding anthropological studies on health relations. The notion
                of political economy stems from the study of ‘the wealth of nations’ of capitalism, centring upon the
                production and distribution of wealth within and between political bodies and the social classes
                (Singer, 2004). In such a vein, a critical aspect, and possibly the core of critical medical
                anthropology, lies in its entanglement with the dominance of a capitalist world and its non-hierarchical
                social classes constructed. The capability of critical medical anthropology to approach health relations
                on a broader scale of social life sets it apart from other theoretical orientations found in medical
                anthropology: the empiricist paradigm, the cognitive paradigm, the meaning-centred paradigm (Good, in
                Singer, 2004). By stepping away from excessive scrutiny of the subtle details of individual cultural
                cases, critical medical anthropology can provide insights into the homogenising processes which
                vulnerable populations often suffer from hegemonic political economy. Yet, this is not to say that
                critical medical anthropology dismisses the microanalyses of illness and healing of ethnographic
                research through the lens of socioculturalism, but rather to offer insights how health behaviours and
                attitudes are embedded in historically delineated political-economic contexts of social inequality of
                power (Singer and Baer, 2004). For anthropological ethnographies risk ethnicising marginalised groups as
                independent identities, critical medical anthropology avoids itself from exoticising certain groups of
                individuals by zooming out on the interconnections between individual and social well-being within
                overarching political economy structures (Ortner, in Singer 1994). Critical medical anthropology, in
                such a vein, serves everyone who are under structural inequality, and particularly those who are
                marginalised at the bottom of the social alignment of power.
            </p>
            <p> In a similar vein to other theoretical paradigms of medical anthropology, a critical aspect of critical
                medical anthropology is centred upon how the biomedical framework is overly reductionist in attributing
                all causes of illness to physical entities of scientific objectivity. Critical medical anthropologists
                elaborated on WHO’s definition of health ‘as a state of complete physical, mental being and social
                well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ to now define it as ‘access to and
                control over the basic material and nonmaterial resources that sustain and promote life at a high level
                of satisfaction’ (Singer, 2004). Since critical medical anthropology incorporates broader social forces
                into discussions of well-being, health is thereby an elastic concept that is subject to afflictions
                embedded in violence and instability rooted in political economy, spanning across geographical regions
                and temporal distances. For instance, in his essay ‘An Anthropology of Structural Violence’, Farmer
                (2004) discusses how structural violence, namely racism, gender inequality, brute poverty, becomes
                embodied as risks of illness and, for those already harmed, dangers of ultimate death in Haiti. Here,
                another critical point of critical medical anthropology is its ability to ‘study up’ the transnational
                structural violence that is overshadowed by extreme poverty recorded in details of what is only
                ethnographically visible. What is often neglected is an account of the political economy that constructs
                the reality of Haiti today, as Farmer beautifully puts it into a metaphor of ‘we see the puddles,
                perhaps, but not the rainstorms and certainly not the gathering thunderclouds’ (Farmer, 2004).
                Neoliberalism dominates every arena of social life in Haiti embedded in the ‘invisible hand of the
                market’ that manipulates every person’s social and biological wellbeing. High rates of HIV infection in
                Haiti have non-biological ties to the exchange of money carried out in the form of the commodification
                of bodies in sex tourism (ibid.). The AIDS prevalence in Haiti is a tragic story of proximity, not
                distance. In other words, high rates of HIV in Haiti have more to do with structural violence embedded
                in inequalities of wealth and power in a capitalist world than with non-Western, sociocultural, and
                'primitive' sexual behaviours. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology offers insights into
                redefining disease and illness in the discussion of health problems. Disease is more than just the
                result of pathogenic infections; rather, it is culturally constructed across geographical conditions,
                which differ due to the unequal social distribution of resources (Singer, 2004).
            </p>

            <p>We see further discussions around disease and illness in multispecies ethnography of cross-species
                transmission of disease. The H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia illuminates how global-scale political forces
                are able to shape the spread of seemingly independent viral entities that biomedicine deems to be
                separated from sociocultural worlds (Lowe, 2010). The First World pressures the Third World to halt the
                spread of H5N1 in its tracks as a desire to control a global viral matter 'on the ground' before it
                crosses culturally constructed territorial boundaries. The disease, a biomedically constructed cultural
                concept, similarly becomes subject to political-economic forces, and, in a cloud of quasi-species
                intermingling, is given new identities associated with traditional Asian agricultural practices, which
                then become viewed as a potent source of risks (Lowe, 2010).</p>
            <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,

            <p>Critical medical anthropology therefore is a synthetic approach to understanding health and illness from
                multiple perspectives encompassing the microparasitism (individual level causes of much sickness) and
                the macroparasitism (social level roots of political economy that is the ultimate cause of much illness)
                (Singer, 2004). This idea is similarly echoed in another ‘critical’ aspect of critical medical
                anthropology - an approach of syndemics to understand social and biological interconnections of illness.
                The simplest definition of syndemics according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
                is ‘two or more epidemics (i.e., notable increases in the rate of specific diseases in a population),
                interacting synergistically with each other inside human bodies and contributing, as a result of their
                interaction, to excess burden of disease in a population’ (Singer and Baer, 2004). Critical medical
                anthropology leverages such a biomedical understanding of comorbidity to incorporate the role of social,
                environmental, and economic factors, namely poverty, racism, sexism, ostracism, and structural violence
                in co-shaping health outcomes (ibid.). This is to say that syndemics are most likely to occur in areas
                vulnerable to structural inequality of power and resource allocations. Singer et al. (2017) used the
                term SAVA (substance abuse, violence, and AIDS) to exemplify the interconnection of biological, social,
                and environmental factors in the spread of AIDS as an urban health crisis in the USA. The urban poor
                face a set of synergistic health and social problems strongly influenced by macro level political
                economic factors, including unemployment, poverty, poor nutrition, occupational and environmental health
                risks (Singer, 1994). These social risks of health co-occur with AIDS and are further in comorbidity
                with higher levels of risk for cardiovascular disease and pancreatic malfunctions, which research on
                racial genetic predisposition fails to address. Structural violence embedded in everyday life disposes
                the urban poor of a higher likelihood of substance abuse and exposure to HIV, which further damages the
                immune system that leads to co-morbidity of other diseases like tuberculosis (Singer, 1994).
                Furthermore, syndemic not only brings physical suffering to the vulnerable but also, through the
                sociocultural construction of disease, acts as an objectifying category that exoticizes the sufferers.
                Critical medical anthropology serves to break down prejudice against marginalised groups who suffer
                discrimination from culturally constructed terms such as GRID (gay-related immunodeficiency), gay
                cancer, gay pneumonia (Singer, 1994). A critique of critical medical anthropology is to view culture
                categories as not simply socially constituted but as socially constituting, that are fluid entities
                which shape human behaviours as part of the shifting political economic situations. Rather than playing
                the victim blaming card on the marginalised and categorising their cultural beliefs into exoticised
                settings, critical medical anthropology reconceptualises sufferings as a biosocial product influencing
                all.</p>

            <p> Applying critical medical anthropology to the field further sheds light on the power imbalance between
                the hegemonic biomedical healthcare system and non-Western medicine practitioners, especially during
                clinical encounters. Taussig criticises both medicine and conventional medical anthropology for deifying
                the diagnosis of disease but neglecting the social relations embodied in symptoms, signs, and therapy
                (Singer, 1989). This deification of biomedicine exacerbates a sense of medical hegemony in clinical
                encounters where capitalist values permeate medical diagnosis and treatment (Witeska-Mlynarczyk, 2015).
                Critiques from critical medical anthropology highlight how the explanatory model fails to recognize the
                exploitative character of the power imbalance in the clinical relationship as a reflection of the
                broader level of social inequality and power (Estroff, 1988). While it is essential to incorporate
                people's knowledge of illness into therapeutics, critical medical anthropology moves beyond the
                explanatory model by focusing on negotiations within the differential power of the two actors comprising
                the clinical relationship. Such negotiations may still be dominated by a medical expert, positioning the
                patient at subordination—directing the patient’s attention to the entities of disease and the blame of
                bad habits away from structural inequality which permeates the everyday arena of life. This also points
                to another ‘critical’ aspect of critical medical anthropology in highlighting medical pluralism in the
                healthcare sector today. While conventional medical anthropology has advocated for the inclusion of
                non-Western medical therapeutics in the healthcare sector today, Western medical systems still dominate
                over other heterodox or ethnomedical traditions, as a reflection of the hegemonic imbalance of the
                global political economy (Witeska-Mlynarczyk, 2015). It is a healthcare system known better as ‘plural’
                rather than ‘pluralistic’.</p>

            <p>To conclude, critical medical anthropology moves beyond the narrow focus on the minutiae of everyday
                life towards a broader scale of political economy discussion that highlights the structural violence
                embedded in the health behaviors and outcomes of marginalized groups. Critical medical anthropology
                invites readers to realize the prevalence of the social machinery of oppression in a capitalist world—an
                ever-sinking swamp so powerful that every stakeholder in society is drawn into and sinking at different
                scales. This essay has shown how critical medical anthropology reconceptualizes disease and illness as
                concepts of political-economic construction, reimagines the sufferings of the most marginalized groups
                biosocially, and redirects our attention beyond the explanatory model to recognize the hegemonic power
                of biomedicine in clinical encounters. By studying up, critical medical anthropology allows for
                multisite ethnographies of multiple stakeholders in health systems (Pfeiffer and Nichter, 2008). Rather
                than focusing on the short-term, immediate causes of disease, critical medical anthropology informs
                policymakers, health practitioners, and the sufferers of the need to look at longer-term, more systemic
                public health efforts embedded in structural inequality of power in a world dominated by capitalism.</p>

        <h2>Anthropology of the Body: </h2>
        <p>4. Why might it be important to focus on persons and relations rather than “the body” as it is configured in
            Euro-American medical research?</p>

        <h2> I:</h2>
        <p>If a body is configured, it more or less suggests a notion of particularity, or a way of knowing that is
            arranged in a distinct underlying set of values. This is reflected in Benedict’s (1934) proposition that
            ‘order’ exists in the minds of the members of the culture. In her discussion of configurationalism, Benedict
            (1934: 254) posits that cultures derived from ‘a segment of the possible human behaviours’ and tend to
            further ‘the expression of its segments and inhibit its opposite expressions’. In such a vein, configuration
            argues for a sense of determinism that once a set of values is settled ‘all miscellaneous behaviours are
            made in accordance with the unconscious canon of choices’ (Salzman, 2001: 70). This essay argues that ‘the
            body’ is configured In Euro-American medical research as bounded, isolated, and objectified. Rooted in the
            Cartesian metaphysics, Euro-American medical systems address ‘the body’ as demarcated from the mind of the
            person, and through a biomedical lens, the body is a bounded entity unaffected by external forces like
            social relations. Alternatively, bodies can be exposed to the outer world, maintaining responsiveness to
            shifts in social circumstances, thereby engendering new personhoods and identities [McCallum, 1996]. This
            essay seeks to delve into the importance of centering attention on persons and relations when understanding
            body configurations. It aims to challenge the established paradigm of body configuration within
            Euro-American medical research through three aspects: 1) contesting the notion of the body as a mere object
            for the medical gaze, 2) refuting the conception of the body as isolated from its social milieu, and 3)
            dispelling the assumption that the body remains inert in response to sociocultural influences.
