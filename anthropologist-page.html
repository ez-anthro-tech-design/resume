                <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                    large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                    the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,
                    and economic factors in every arena of social life (Estroff, 1988). Instead of adopting a horizontal
                    approach that views all individuals as equals in the ever-sinking whirlpool of Capitalism, critical
                    medical anthropology delineates the "vertical links" connecting different social groups positioned
                    along the non-hierarchical axis of social life. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology
                    addresses the social alignment of power that profits a small group of individuals while exploiting
                    the large mass of others who are marginalised in the Capitalocene (Singer, 1989). Critical medical
                    anthropology looks beyond the socioculturalist view, which delved too deeply into the microlevel
                    analysis of social life to the extent of lacking, if not completely neglecting, the macro level view
                    of external political and economic forces that also shape the health behaviours and outcomes of
                    populations. This essay aims to provide readers with a macro-level approach to human suffering and
                    illness in critical medical anthropology, lifting our gaze from immersing too deeply in the
                    fascinating minutiae of field experiences (Singer, 1989). This essay will first examine what is
                    'critical' about critical medical anthropology by discussing how it marries broader social relations
                    of the political economy to micro-level understandings of local sociocultural insights into
                    suffering and illness. Extending the realisation of power, control, and exploitation in political
                    economy, this essay will further address the ‘criticals’ of CMA through a discussion on the
                    shortcomings of the biomedical model in creating a dichotomy between natural and cultural
                    constructions of of health, disease, and illness (Singer and Baer, 2004). After dispelling the
                    dichotomised view of sociocultural and biological roots of suffering, another ‘critical’ aspect of
                    critical medical anthropology is recognising suffering as a syndemic in the context of a biosocial
                    construction of health (Singer et al., 2017). The syndemics of health thus emphasise who some of the
                    subjects of critical medical anthropology studies are - those who have long been marginalised,
                    victimised, and neglected in the discussion of health policies due to the medical hegemony of
                    Western biomedical values, coupled with the global adoption of a capitalist political economy. In
                    this regard, critical medical anthropology can illustrate how, even with a deeper exploration of the
                    nuances of sociocultural influences on health behaviours, medical pluralism remains 'plural' rather
                    than 'pluralistic' under the dominance of biomedicine (Singer and Baer, 2004).
                </p>
                <p> The term ‘critical’ within critical medical anthropology has often been employed interchangeably
                    with
                    political economy when it comes to understanding anthropological studies on health relations. The
                    notion
                    of political economy stems from the study of ‘the wealth of nations’ of capitalism, centring upon
                    the
                    production and distribution of wealth within and between political bodies and the social classes
                    (Singer, 2004). In such a vein, a critical aspect, and possibly the core of critical medical
                    anthropology, lies in its entanglement with the dominance of a capitalist world and its
                    non-hierarchical
                    social classes constructed. The capability of critical medical anthropology to approach health
                    relations
                    on a broader scale of social life sets it apart from other theoretical orientations found in medical
                    anthropology: the empiricist paradigm, the cognitive paradigm, the meaning-centred paradigm (Good,
                    in
                    Singer, 2004). By stepping away from excessive scrutiny of the subtle details of individual cultural
                    cases, critical medical anthropology can provide insights into the homogenising processes which
                    vulnerable populations often suffer from hegemonic political economy. Yet, this is not to say that
                    critical medical anthropology dismisses the microanalyses of illness and healing of ethnographic
                    research through the lens of socioculturalism, but rather to offer insights how health behaviours
                    and
                    attitudes are embedded in historically delineated political-economic contexts of social inequality
                    of
                    power (Singer and Baer, 2004). For anthropological ethnographies risk ethnicising marginalised
                    groups as
                    independent identities, critical medical anthropology avoids itself from exoticising certain groups
                    of
                    individuals by zooming out on the interconnections between individual and social well-being within
                    overarching political economy structures (Ortner, in Singer 1994). Critical medical anthropology, in
                    such a vein, serves everyone who are under structural inequality, and particularly those who are
                    marginalised at the bottom of the social alignment of power.
                </p>
                <p> In a similar vein to other theoretical paradigms of medical anthropology, a critical aspect of
                    critical
                    medical anthropology is centred upon how the biomedical framework is overly reductionist in
                    attributing
                    all causes of illness to physical entities of scientific objectivity. Critical medical
                    anthropologists
                    elaborated on WHO’s definition of health ‘as a state of complete physical, mental being and social
                    well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ to now define it as ‘access to and
                    control over the basic material and nonmaterial resources that sustain and promote life at a high
                    level
                    of satisfaction’ (Singer, 2004). Since critical medical anthropology incorporates broader social
                    forces
                    into discussions of well-being, health is thereby an elastic concept that is subject to afflictions
                    embedded in violence and instability rooted in political economy, spanning across geographical
                    regions
                    and temporal distances. For instance, in his essay ‘An Anthropology of Structural Violence’, Farmer
                    (2004) discusses how structural violence, namely racism, gender inequality, brute poverty, becomes
                    embodied as risks of illness and, for those already harmed, dangers of ultimate death in Haiti.
                    Here,
                    another critical point of critical medical anthropology is its ability to ‘study up’ the
                    transnational
                    structural violence that is overshadowed by extreme poverty recorded in details of what is only
                    ethnographically visible. What is often neglected is an account of the political economy that
                    constructs
                    the reality of Haiti today, as Farmer beautifully puts it into a metaphor of ‘we see the puddles,
                    perhaps, but not the rainstorms and certainly not the gathering thunderclouds’ (Farmer, 2004).
                    Neoliberalism dominates every arena of social life in Haiti embedded in the ‘invisible hand of the
                    market’ that manipulates every person’s social and biological wellbeing. High rates of HIV infection
                    in
                    Haiti have non-biological ties to the exchange of money carried out in the form of the
                    commodification
                    of bodies in sex tourism (ibid.). The AIDS prevalence in Haiti is a tragic story of proximity, not
                    distance. In other words, high rates of HIV in Haiti have more to do with structural violence
                    embedded
                    in inequalities of wealth and power in a capitalist world than with non-Western, sociocultural, and
                    'primitive' sexual behaviours. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology offers insights into
                    redefining disease and illness in the discussion of health problems. Disease is more than just the
                    result of pathogenic infections; rather, it is culturally constructed across geographical
                    conditions,
                    which differ due to the unequal social distribution of resources (Singer, 2004).
                </p>

                <p>We see further discussions around disease and illness in multispecies ethnography of cross-species
                    transmission of disease. The H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia illuminates how global-scale political
                    forces
                    are able to shape the spread of seemingly independent viral entities that biomedicine deems to be
                    separated from sociocultural worlds (Lowe, 2010). The First World pressures the Third World to halt
                    the
                    spread of H5N1 in its tracks as a desire to control a global viral matter 'on the ground' before it
                    crosses culturally constructed territorial boundaries. The disease, a biomedically constructed
                    cultural
                    concept, similarly becomes subject to political-economic forces, and, in a cloud of quasi-species
                    intermingling, is given new identities associated with traditional Asian agricultural practices,
                    which
                    then become viewed as a potent source of risks (Lowe, 2010).</p>
                <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                    large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                    the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,

                    medical anthropology is centred upon how the biomedical framework is overly reductionist in
                    attributing
                    all causes of illness to physical entities of scientific objectivity. Critical medical
                    anthropologists
                    elaborated on WHO’s definition of health ‘as a state of complete physical, mental being and social
                    well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ to now define it as ‘access to and
                    control over the basic material and nonmaterial resources that sustain and promote life at a high
                    level
                    of satisfaction’ (Singer, 2004). Since critical medical anthropology incorporates broader social
                    forces
                    into discussions of well-being, health is thereby an elastic concept that is subject to afflictions
                    embedded in violence and instability rooted in political economy, spanning across geographical
                    regions
                    and temporal distances. For instance, in his essay ‘An Anthropology of Structural Violence’, Farmer
                    (2004) discusses how structural violence, namely racism, gender inequality, brute poverty, becomes
                    embodied as risks of illness and, for those already harmed, dangers of ultimate death in Haiti.
                    Here,
                    another critical point of critical medical anthropology is its ability to ‘study up’ the
                    transnational
                    structural violence that is overshadowed by extreme poverty recorded in details of what is only
                    ethnographically visible. What is often neglected is an account of the political economy that
                    constructs
                    the reality of Haiti today, as Farmer beautifully puts it into a metaphor of ‘we see the puddles,
                    perhaps, but not the rainstorms and certainly not the gathering thunderclouds’ (Farmer, 2004).
                    Neoliberalism dominates every arena of social life in Haiti embedded in the ‘invisible hand of the
                    market’ that manipulates every person’s social and biological wellbeing. High rates of HIV infection
                    in
                    Haiti have non-biological ties to the exchange of money carried out in the form of the
                    commodification
                    of bodies in sex tourism (ibid.). The AIDS prevalence in Haiti is a tragic story of proximity, not
                    distance. In other words, high rates of HIV in Haiti have more to do with structural violence
                    embedded
                    in inequalities of wealth and power in a capitalist world than with non-Western, sociocultural, and
                    'primitive' sexual behaviours. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology offers insights into
                    redefining disease and illness in the discussion of health problems. Disease is more than just the
                    result of pathogenic infections; rather, it is culturally constructed across geographical
                    conditions,
                    which differ due to the unequal social distribution of resources (Singer, 2004).
                </p>

                <p>We see further discussions around disease and illness in multispecies ethnography of cross-species
                    transmission of disease. The H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia illuminates how global-scale political
                    forces
                    are able to shape the spread of seemingly independent viral entities that biomedicine deems to be
                    separated from sociocultural worlds (Lowe, 2010). The First World pressures the Third World to halt
                    the
                    spread of H5N1 in its tracks as a desire to control a global viral matter 'on the ground' before it
                    crosses culturally constructed territorial boundaries. The disease, a biomedically constructed
                    cultural
                    concept, similarly becomes subject to political-economic forces, and, in a cloud of quasi-species
                    intermingling, is given new identities associated with traditional Asian agricultural practices,
                    which
                    then become viewed as a potent source of risks (Lowe, 2010).</p>
                <p>Critical medical anthropology therefore is a synthetic approach to understanding health and illness
                    from
                    multiple perspectives encompassing the microparasitism (individual level causes of much sickness)
                    and
                    the macroparasitism (social level roots of political economy that is the ultimate cause of much
                    illness)
                    (Singer, 2004). This idea is similarly echoed in another ‘critical’ aspect of critical medical
                    anthropology - an approach of syndemics to understand social and biological interconnections of
                    illness.
                    The simplest definition of syndemics according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    (CDC)
                    is ‘two or more epidemics (i.e., notable increases in the rate of specific diseases in a
                    population),
                    interacting synergistically with each other inside human bodies and contributing, as a result of
                    their
                    interaction, to excess burden of disease in a population’ (Singer and Baer, 2004). Critical medical
                    anthropology leverages such a biomedical understanding of comorbidity to incorporate the role of
                    social,
                    environmental, and economic factors, namely poverty, racism, sexism, ostracism, and structural
                    violence
                    in co-shaping health outcomes (ibid.). This is to say that syndemics are most likely to occur in
                    areas
                    vulnerable to structural inequality of power and resource allocations. Singer et al. (2017) used the
                    term SAVA (substance abuse, violence, and AIDS) to exemplify the interconnection of biological,
                    social,
                    and environmental factors in the spread of AIDS as an urban health crisis in the USA. The urban poor
                    face a set of synergistic health and social problems strongly influenced by macro level political
                    economic factors, including unemployment, poverty, poor nutrition, occupational and environmental
                    health
                    risks (Singer, 1994). These social risks of health co-occur with AIDS and are further in comorbidity
                    with higher levels of risk for cardiovascular disease and pancreatic malfunctions, which research on
                    racial genetic predisposition fails to address. Structural violence embedded in everyday life
                    disposes
                    the urban poor of a higher likelihood of substance abuse and exposure to HIV, which further damages
                    the
                    immune system that leads to co-morbidity of other diseases like tuberculosis (Singer, 1994).
                    Furthermore, syndemic not only brings physical suffering to the vulnerable but also, through the
                    sociocultural construction of disease, acts as an objectifying category that exoticizes the
                    sufferers.
                    Critical medical anthropology serves to break down prejudice against marginalised groups who suffer
                    discrimination from culturally constructed terms such as GRID (gay-related immunodeficiency), gay
                    cancer, gay pneumonia (Singer, 1994). A critique of critical medical anthropology is to view culture
                    categories as not simply socially constituted but as socially constituting, that are fluid entities
                    which shape human behaviours as part of the shifting political economic situations. Rather than
                    playing
                    the victim blaming card on the marginalised and categorising their cultural beliefs into exoticised
                    settings, critical medical anthropology reconceptualises sufferings as a biosocial product
                    influencing
                    all.</p>

                <p> Applying critical medical anthropology to the field further sheds light on the power imbalance
                    between
                    the hegemonic biomedical healthcare system and non-Western medicine practitioners, especially during
                    clinical encounters. Taussig criticises both medicine and conventional medical anthropology for
                    deifying
                    the diagnosis of disease but neglecting the social relations embodied in symptoms, signs, and
                    therapy
                    (Singer, 1989). This deification of biomedicine exacerbates a sense of medical hegemony in clinical
                    encounters where capitalist values permeate medical diagnosis and treatment (Witeska-Mlynarczyk,
                    2015).
                    Critiques from critical medical anthropology highlight how the explanatory model fails to recognize
                    the
                    exploitative character of the power imbalance in the clinical relationship as a reflection of the
                    broader level of social inequality and power (Estroff, 1988). While it is essential to incorporate
                    people's knowledge of illness into therapeutics, critical medical anthropology moves beyond the
                    explanatory model by focusing on negotiations within the differential power of the two actors
                    comprising
                    the clinical relationship. Such negotiations may still be dominated by a medical expert, positioning
                    the
                    patient at subordination—directing the patient’s attention to the entities of disease and the blame
                    of
                    bad habits away from structural inequality which permeates the everyday arena of life. This also
                    points
                    to another ‘critical’ aspect of critical medical anthropology in highlighting medical pluralism in
                    the
                    healthcare sector today. While conventional medical anthropology has advocated for the inclusion of
                    non-Western medical therapeutics in the healthcare sector today, Western medical systems still
                    dominate
                    over other heterodox or ethnomedical traditions, as a reflection of the hegemonic imbalance of the
                    global political economy (Witeska-Mlynarczyk, 2015). It is a healthcare system known better as
                    ‘plural’
                    rather than ‘pluralistic’.</p>

                <p>To conclude, critical medical anthropology moves beyond the narrow focus on the minutiae of everyday
                    life towards a broader scale of political economy discussion that highlights the structural violence
                    embedded in the health behaviors and outcomes of marginalized groups. Critical medical anthropology
                    invites readers to realize the prevalence of the social machinery of oppression in a capitalist
                    world—an
                    ever-sinking swamp so powerful that every stakeholder in society is drawn into and sinking at
                    different
                    scales. This essay has shown how critical medical anthropology reconceptualizes disease and illness
                    as
                    concepts of political-economic construction, reimagines the sufferings of the most marginalized
                    groups
                    biosocially, and redirects our attention beyond the explanatory model to recognize the hegemonic
                    power
                    of biomedicine in clinical encounters. By studying up, critical medical anthropology allows for
                    multisite ethnographies of multiple stakeholders in health systems (Pfeiffer and Nichter, 2008).
                    Rather
                    than focusing on the short-term, immediate causes of disease, critical medical anthropology informs
                    policymakers, health practitioners, and the sufferers of the need to look at longer-term, more
                    systemic
                    public health efforts embedded in structural inequality of power in a world dominated by capitalism.
