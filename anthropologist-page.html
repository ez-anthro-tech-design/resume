                <h2> I:</h2>
                <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                    large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                    the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,
                    and economic factors in every arena of social life (Estroff, 1988). Instead of adopting a horizontal
                    approach that views all individuals as equals in the ever-sinking whirlpool of Capitalism, critical
                    medical anthropology delineates the "vertical links" connecting different social groups positioned
                    along the non-hierarchical axis of social life. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology
                    addresses the social alignment of power that profits a small group of individuals while exploiting
                    the large mass of others who are marginalised in the Capitalocene (Singer, 1989). Critical medical
                    anthropology looks beyond the socioculturalist view, which delved too deeply into the microlevel
                    analysis of social life to the extent of lacking, if not completely neglecting, the macro level view
                    of external political and economic forces that also shape the health behaviours and outcomes of
                    populations. This essay aims to provide readers with a macro-level approach to human suffering and
                    illness in critical medical anthropology, lifting our gaze from immersing too deeply in the
                    fascinating minutiae of field experiences (Singer, 1989). This essay will first examine what is
                    'critical' about critical medical anthropology by discussing how it marries broader social relations
                    of the political economy to micro-level understandings of local sociocultural insights into
                    suffering and illness. Extending the realisation of power, control, and exploitation in political
                    economy, this essay will further address the ‘criticals’ of CMA through a discussion on the
                    shortcomings of the biomedical model in creating a dichotomy between natural and cultural
                    constructions of of health, disease, and illness (Singer and Baer, 2004). After dispelling the
                    dichotomised view of sociocultural and biological roots of suffering, another ‘critical’ aspect of
                    critical medical anthropology is recognising suffering as a syndemic in the context of a biosocial
                    construction of health (Singer et al., 2017). The syndemics of health thus emphasise who some of the
                    subjects of critical medical anthropology studies are - those who have long been marginalised,
                    victimised, and neglected in the discussion of health policies due to the medical hegemony of
                    Western biomedical values, coupled with the global adoption of a capitalist political economy. In
                    this regard, critical medical anthropology can illustrate how, even with a deeper exploration of the
                    nuances of sociocultural influences on health behaviours, medical pluralism remains 'plural' rather
                    than 'pluralistic' under the dominance of biomedicine (Singer and Baer, 2004).
