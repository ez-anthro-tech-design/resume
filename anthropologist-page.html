            <div class="essay-author">Keywords: Biomedicine; Healthcare Systems; Public Health</div>
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>...In a similar vein to other theoretical paradigms of medical anthropology, a critical aspect of
                    critical medical anthropology is centred upon how the biomedical framework is overly reductionist in
                    attributing all causes of illness to physical entities of scientific objectivity. Critical medical
                    anthropologists elaborated on WHO’s definition of health ‘as a state of complete physical, mental
                    being and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ to now define it as
                    ‘access to and control over the basic material and nonmaterial resources that sustain and promote
                    life at a high level of satisfaction’ (Singer, 2004). Since critical medical anthropology
                    incorporates broader social forces into discussions of well-being, health is thereby an elastic
                    concept that is subject to afflictions embedded in violence and instability rooted in political
                    economy, spanning across geographical regions and temporal distances. For instance, in his essay ‘An
                    Anthropology of Structural Violence’, Farmer (2004) discusses how structural violence, namely
                    racism, gender inequality, brute poverty, becomes embodied as risks of illness and, for those
                    already harmed, dangers of ultimate death in Haiti. Here, another critical point of critical medical
                    anthropology is its ability to ‘study up’ the transnational structural violence that is overshadowed
                    by extreme poverty recorded in details of what is only ethnographically visible. What is often
                    neglected is an account of the political economy that constructs the reality of Haiti today, as
                    Farmer beautifully puts it into a metaphor of ‘we see the puddles, perhaps, but not the rainstorms
                    and certainly not the gathering thunderclouds’ (Farmer, 2004). Neoliberalism dominates every arena
                    of social life in Haiti embedded in the ‘invisible hand of the market’ that manipulates every
                    person’s social and biological wellbeing. High rates of HIV infection in Haiti have non-biological
                    ties to the exchange of money carried out in the form of the commodification of bodies in sex
                    tourism (ibid.). The AIDS prevalence in Haiti is a tragic story of proximity, not distance. In other
                    words, high rates of HIV in Haiti have more to do with structural violence embedded in inequalities
                    of wealth and power in a capitalist world than with non-Western, sociocultural, and 'primitive'
                    sexual behaviours. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology offers insights into redefining
                    disease and illness in the discussion of health problems. Disease is more than just the result of
                    pathogenic infections; rather, it is culturally constructed across geographical conditions, which
                    differ due to the unequal social distribution of resources (Singer, 2004).

                <p>...Their work showcased diverse approaches to product development, involving volumetric modelling,
                    artificial intelligence, and leveraging healthcare data. Yet surprisingly, only one of the products
                    briefly touched on 'user/patient experience.' This raised questions about what it means for a
                    medical imaging company whose entire product line revolves around using patients' bodies to generate
                    profits. What role does a patient play in shaping their own body through a medical lens that
                    quantifies and models the body into visual images? And ultimately, will the patient have a stake in
                    the rapidly growing stock of the company, considering that it is their body being analysed?...</p>

            <div class="essay-author">Keywords: Lived-experience; Resonance; Anthropology of the Body</div>
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>...As individuals resonate with the atmosphere in the natural environment, their well-being is also
                    embodied in the sensory experience and cognitive pattering gained through their interactions with
                    the world. As defined in this essay, well-being is a subjective experience that reflects an
                    individual’s own understanding of being-in-the-world (Baines 2018: 7). Through interactions with the
                    outer world, individuals may incorporate socioeconomic, political, environmental, and historical
                    events into their body, highlighting the fluidity and porous nature of the body in resonating with
                    the atmosphere. Embodiment manifests in everyday life and is sustained by temporality and
                    spatiality. Bains (2018: 20) writes about Caribbean and Latin American immigrant households in New
                    York City, who maintain ecological traditions after relocating to urban environments. These
                    individuals believe in the holistic health beneifts of practising ecological traditions, including
                    physically foraging unprocessed ingredients, socially participating in familial labour activities,
                    and mentally slowing down to relax (Baines 2018: 20). The collective engagement in such tangible
                    ‘culinary care’ practices highlight how perceptions of well-being are not singularly defined by
                    objective pathological diagnoses, but rather by subjective experiences that embody historical,
                    environmental, and social forces (Baines 2018: 21).

            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>...If a body is configured, it more or less suggests a notion of particularity, or a way of knowing
                    that is arranged in a distinct underlying set of values. This is reflected in Benedict’s (1934)
                    proposition that ‘order’ exists in the minds of the members of the culture. In her discussion of
                    configurationalism, Benedict (1934: 254) posits that cultures derived from ‘a segment of the
                    possible human behaviours’ and tend to further ‘the expression of its segments and inhibit its
                    opposite expressions’. In such a vein, configuration argues for a sense of determinism that once a
                    set of values is settled ‘all miscellaneous behaviours are made in accordance with the unconscious
                    canon of choices’ (Salzman, 2001: 70). This essay argues that ‘the body’ is configured In
                    Euro-American medical research as bounded, isolated, and objectified. Rooted in the Cartesian
                    metaphysics, Euro-American medical systems address ‘the body’ as demarcated from the mind of the
                    person, and through a biomedical lens, the body is a bounded entity unaffected by external forces
                    like social relations. Alternatively, bodies can be exposed to the outer world, maintaining
                    responsiveness to shifts in social circumstances, thereby engendering new personhoods and identities
                    [McCallum, 1996].
