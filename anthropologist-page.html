            <p>What is ‘critical’ about critical medical anthropology? Who does this critique serve?
                .</p>

            <h2> I:</h2>
            <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,
                and economic factors in every arena of social life (Estroff, 1988). Instead of adopting a horizontal
                approach that views all individuals as equals in the ever-sinking whirlpool of Capitalism, critical
                medical anthropology delineates the "vertical links" connecting different social groups positioned
                along the non-hierarchical axis of social life. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology
                addresses the social alignment of power that profits a small group of individuals while exploiting
                the large mass of others who are marginalised in the Capitalocene (Singer, 1989). Critical medical
                anthropology looks beyond the socioculturalist view, which delved too deeply into the microlevel
                analysis of social life to the extent of lacking, if not completely neglecting, the macro level view
                of external political and economic forces that also shape the health behaviours and outcomes of
                populations. This essay aims to provide readers with a macro-level approach to human suffering and
                illness in critical medical anthropology, lifting our gaze from immersing too deeply in the
                fascinating minutiae of field experiences (Singer, 1989). This essay will first examine what is
                'critical' about critical medical anthropology by discussing how it marries broader social relations
                of the political economy to micro-level understandings of local sociocultural insights into
                suffering and illness. Extending the realisation of power, control, and exploitation in political
                economy, this essay will further address the ‘criticals’ of CMA through a discussion on the
                shortcomings of the biomedical model in creating a dichotomy between natural and cultural
                constructions of of health, disease, and illness (Singer and Baer, 2004). After dispelling the
                dichotomised view of sociocultural and biological roots of suffering, another ‘critical’ aspect of
                critical medical anthropology is recognising suffering as a syndemic in the context of a biosocial
                construction of health (Singer et al., 2017). The syndemics of health thus emphasise who some of the
                subjects of critical medical anthropology studies are - those who have long been marginalised,
                victimised, and neglected in the discussion of health policies due to the medical hegemony of
                Western biomedical values, coupled with the global adoption of a capitalist political economy. In
                this regard, critical medical anthropology can illustrate how, even with a deeper exploration of the
                nuances of sociocultural influences on health behaviours, medical pluralism remains 'plural' rather
                than 'pluralistic' under the dominance of biomedicine (Singer and Baer, 2004).
            </p>
            <p> The term ‘critical’ within critical medical anthropology has often been employed interchangeably with
                political economy when it comes to understanding anthropological studies on health relations. The notion
                of political economy stems from the study of ‘the wealth of nations’ of capitalism, centring upon the
                production and distribution of wealth within and between political bodies and the social classes
                (Singer, 2004). In such a vein, a critical aspect, and possibly the core of critical medical
                anthropology, lies in its entanglement with the dominance of a capitalist world and its non-hierarchical
                social classes constructed. The capability of critical medical anthropology to approach health relations
                on a broader scale of social life sets it apart from other theoretical orientations found in medical
                anthropology: the empiricist paradigm, the cognitive paradigm, the meaning-centred paradigm (Good, in
                Singer, 2004). By stepping away from excessive scrutiny of the subtle details of individual cultural
                cases, critical medical anthropology can provide insights into the homogenising processes which
                vulnerable populations often suffer from hegemonic political economy. Yet, this is not to say that
                critical medical anthropology dismisses the microanalyses of illness and healing of ethnographic
                research through the lens of socioculturalism, but rather to offer insights how health behaviours and
                attitudes are embedded in historically delineated political-economic contexts of social inequality of
                power (Singer and Baer, 2004). For anthropological ethnographies risk ethnicising marginalised groups as
                independent identities, critical medical anthropology avoids itself from exoticising certain groups of
                individuals by zooming out on the interconnections between individual and social well-being within
                overarching political economy structures (Ortner, in Singer 1994). Critical medical anthropology, in
                such a vein, serves everyone who are under structural inequality, and particularly those who are
                marginalised at the bottom of the social alignment of power.
            </p>
            <p> In a similar vein to other theoretical paradigms of medical anthropology, a critical aspect of critical
                medical anthropology is centred upon how the biomedical framework is overly reductionist in attributing
                all causes of illness to physical entities of scientific objectivity. Critical medical anthropologists
                elaborated on WHO’s definition of health ‘as a state of complete physical, mental being and social
                well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ to now define it as ‘access to and
                control over the basic material and nonmaterial resources that sustain and promote life at a high level
                of satisfaction’ (Singer, 2004). Since critical medical anthropology incorporates broader social forces
                into discussions of well-being, health is thereby an elastic concept that is subject to afflictions
                embedded in violence and instability rooted in political economy, spanning across geographical regions
                and temporal distances. For instance, in his essay ‘An Anthropology of Structural Violence’, Farmer
                (2004) discusses how structural violence, namely racism, gender inequality, brute poverty, becomes
                embodied as risks of illness and, for those already harmed, dangers of ultimate death in Haiti. Here,
                another critical point of critical medical anthropology is its ability to ‘study up’ the transnational
                structural violence that is overshadowed by extreme poverty recorded in details of what is only
                ethnographically visible. What is often neglected is an account of the political economy that constructs
                the reality of Haiti today, as Farmer beautifully puts it into a metaphor of ‘we see the puddles,
                perhaps, but not the rainstorms and certainly not the gathering thunderclouds’ (Farmer, 2004).
                Neoliberalism dominates every arena of social life in Haiti embedded in the ‘invisible hand of the
                market’ that manipulates every person’s social and biological wellbeing. High rates of HIV infection in
                Haiti have non-biological ties to the exchange of money carried out in the form of the commodification
                of bodies in sex tourism (ibid.). The AIDS prevalence in Haiti is a tragic story of proximity, not
                distance. In other words, high rates of HIV in Haiti have more to do with structural violence embedded
                in inequalities of wealth and power in a capitalist world than with non-Western, sociocultural, and
                'primitive' sexual behaviours. In such a vein, critical medical anthropology offers insights into
                redefining disease and illness in the discussion of health problems. Disease is more than just the
                result of pathogenic infections; rather, it is culturally constructed across geographical conditions,
                which differ due to the unequal social distribution of resources (Singer, 2004).
            </p>

            <p>We see further discussions around disease and illness in multispecies ethnography of cross-species
                transmission of disease. The H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia illuminates how global-scale political forces
                are able to shape the spread of seemingly independent viral entities that biomedicine deems to be
                separated from sociocultural worlds (Lowe, 2010). The First World pressures the Third World to halt the
                spread of H5N1 in its tracks as a desire to control a global viral matter 'on the ground' before it
                crosses culturally constructed territorial boundaries. The disease, a biomedically constructed cultural
                concept, similarly becomes subject to political-economic forces, and, in a cloud of quasi-species
                intermingling, is given new identities associated with traditional Asian agricultural practices, which
                then become viewed as a potent source of risks (Lowe, 2010).</p>
            <p>In his assertion that "medicine is a social science and politics is nothing else but medicine on a
                large scale," Virchow sets the tone for the role of critical medical anthropology in pointing out
                the invisible causes of human suffering as a result of the interplay of sociocultural, political,
                and economic factors in every arena of social life (Estroff, 1988). Instead of adopting a horizontal

                are able to shape the spread of seemingly independent viral entities that biomedicine deems to be
                separated from sociocultural worlds (Lowe, 2010). The First World pressures the Third World to halt the
                spread of H5N1 in its tracks as a desire to control a global viral matter 'on the ground' before it
                crosses culturally constructed territorial boundaries. The disease, a biomedically constructed cultural
                concept, similarly becomes subject to political-economic forces, and, in a cloud of quasi-species
                intermingling, is given new identities associated with traditional Asian agricultural practices, which
                then become viewed as a potent source of risks (Lowe, 2010).</p>
